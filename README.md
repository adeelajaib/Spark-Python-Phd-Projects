# Spark-Python-Phd-Projects

This repository contains the Spark and Python versions of some of my programs during my Phd.

The file supersymmetry.py is a Spark program which calculates the mass of the lightest particle (called stau)
in the sample dataset "dataset-supersymmetry-1.txt" which is available in the repository.

The file "generate-uniform-rnd" generates a uniform and random distribution of points.
